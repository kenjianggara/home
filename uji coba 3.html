		<p>K-ON! (けいおん!, <i>literally 'Light Music'</i>) is a Japanese slice of life and comedy four-panel comic strip manga
		written and illustrated by Kakifly. 
		It was serialized from 2007 to 2012, and there are six volumes to the manga in total. 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Animation" title="wikipedia:Kyoto Animation" target="_blank">Kyoto Animation</a> produced the anime adaptation, 
		which aired over 2009 and 2010, over two seasons of 12 and 24 episodes respectively, with many extras, bonus shorts, and even a feature length film, which premiered in 2011.</p>
		
		<p>K-ON!'s plot revolves around the Sakuragaoka High School Light Music Club, which was on the brink of being disbanded, until Yui Hirasawa
		joined as its fourth member alongside Ritsu Tainaka, Mio Akiyama, and Tsumugi Kotobuki. Later, they form the band Ho-kago Tea Time with their fifth member, Azusa Nakano. 
		Though they do often spend time writing and performing music, the series focuses more on their day to day lives at school, and the girls of the Light Music Club become notorious for slacking off, trips to luxurious villas, and of course, 
		for afternoon tea time, just like their band's name.</p>
